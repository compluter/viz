# viz
## music video box

retrieves and plays music videos with your music.


## how to use

very preliminary version. requires itunes and iina media player.

with a song playing in itunes, run viz (`src/index.js`) with node.
viz will search youtube for the song and open its music video in iina. 

## goals

i'd like to have viz running as a standalone app and automatically launch a video player of the user's choice. in the video player will be the song's music video playing on mute in sync with the song if feasible. 

this would be good for parties. leverage the selection of spotify or itunes and the music videos available on youtube. 

fallback videos can be provided for songs with no music video.
